# limitedinteraction

Provides simple, backend-independant GUI tools for simple user interaction.

This module provides simple GUI tools that run in their own process, so that it cannot
conflict with the current running event loop. It has no external dependency, and updates
the matplotlib event loop in background (if matplotlib is installed) while waiting for
user action.

## Warning ##

This is still in early development. It will be great, but later.
